## Relevant Experience

**Senior Cloud Engineer**  
Zoom | Barryton, MI | Dec 2023 – Present  

- Served as lead for the Architecture Review Board committee, responsible for architecture, compliance, and security review of all new system onboarding and architectural proposals; ensured alignment with enterprise standards, FedRAMP requirements, risk mitigation, and best practices to support secure, scalable deployments.  
- Architected and implemented full AWS infrastructure as code (CloudFormation + Terraform); primary author/maintainer, designing components end-to-end from client to backend.  
- Led secure GovCloud deployments for FedRAMP customers.  
- Deployed high-performance AI chatbot LLM workloads to EKS clusters on P4d nodes.  
- Introduced and deployed internal tooling (Artifactory, GitLab runners) on EKS to streamline developer workflows.  
- Platform architecture lead: Drove standardization of Terraform modules and GitLab CI/CD with OIDC-based IAM (IRSA), removing individual AWS access and accelerating secure deployments.  
- Designed and implemented IRSA-driven GitLab pipelines and IAM automation for enhanced security and reduced admin overhead.  
- Built ArgoCD "app of apps" patterns with cascading values for consistent multi-region/account management.  
- Managed advanced AWS features: cross-account IAM, AMI/ECR sharing, ODCR, dedicated capacity sharing.  
- Automated AMI builds with AWS Image Builder and HashiCorp Packer.  
- Developed custom Kubernetes controllers and operators using AI-assisted development (Cursor, prompt-driven agents, MCP plugins) to extend EKS capabilities, automate complex logic, and enable teams to leverage advanced AI features more quickly.  
- Enabled engineering teams to integrate AI tools into daily tasks by building prompt-driven agents and AI-assisted workflows, reducing manual effort and accelerating feature delivery and operational efficiency.

**Staff Operations Engineer**  
Khoros | Barryton, MI | Apr 2021 – Dec 2023  

- Architected AWS infrastructure as code across EKS, EC2, Route53, IAM, S3, RDS, VPC, etc., using CloudFormation/Terraform.  
- Kubernetes Architect: Designed EKS bootstrap templates for add-ons (CSI drivers, IAM authenticator, load-balancer-controller, external-dns/secrets, cluster-autoscaler/Karpenter, monitoring/logging) via CloudFormation + Ansible.  
- Managed add-ons through GitOps (Flux/ArgoCD/Helm).  
- Automated complete EKS cluster deployment + bootstrapping in under 45 minutes.
